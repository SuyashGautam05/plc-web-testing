                    <p>
                        A temperature sensor is a device that measures the temperature of a medium (like air, water, or
                        a solid object) and converts it into an electrical signal that can be read or processed.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Working Principle</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most temperature sensors work by detecting changes in physical properties (like resistance,
                            voltage, or current) caused by temperature changes.</li>
                        <li>The sensor’s output can be analog (like voltage or resistance change) or digital (like a
                            direct temperature reading in °C).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector): </b>
                            An RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector) is a sensor whose resistance changes as its
                            temperature changes. The resistance increases as the temperature of the sensor increases.
                            The resistance vs temperature relationship is well known and is repeatable over time. An RTD
                            is a passive device. It does not produce an output on its own. External electronic devices
                            are used to measure the resistance of the sensor by passing a small electrical current
                            through the sensor to generate a voltage.

                            <p><b>Principle of Operation: </b> Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTD) operates on the
                                principle that the electrical resistance of a metal changes predictably in an
                                essentially linear and repeatable manner with changes in temperature. RTD have a
                                positive temperature coefficient (resistance increases with temperature). The resistance
                                of the element at a base temperature is proportional to the length of the element and
                                the inverse of the cross sectional area.<br>A typical electrical circuit designed to
                                measure temperature with RTDs actually measures a change in resistance of the RTD, which
                                is then used to calculate a change in temperature. The resistance of an RTD increases
                                with increasing temperature, just as the resistance of a strain gage increases with
                                increasing strain.

                            A thermocouple is made up of two dissimilar metals, joined together at one end, that produce
                            a voltage (expressed in millivolts) with a change in temperature. The junction of the two
                            metals, called the sensing junction, is connected to extension wires. Any two dissimilar
                            metals may be used to make a thermocouple.

                            <p><b>Principle of Operation: </b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>When two dissimilar metals are connected together, a small voltage called a
                                    thermo-junction voltage is generated at the junction. This is called the Peltier
                                    effect.</li>
                                <li>If the temperature of the junction changes, it causes voltage to change too, which
                                    can be measured by the input circuits of an electronic controller. The output is a
                                    voltage proportional to the temperature difference between the junction and the free
                                    ends. This is called the Thompson effect.</li>
                                <li>Both of these effects can be combined to measure temperature. By holding one
                                    junction at a known temperature (reference junction) and measuring the voltage, the
                                    temperature at the sensing junction can be deduced. The voltage generated is
                                    directly proportional to the temperature difference. The combined effect is known as
                                    the thermo-junction effect or the Seebeck effect.</li>

                                The voltage is measured to infer the temperature. In practical operation, wires A and B

                                acquisition system, or some other voltage measuring device. If the measuring device has
                                very high input impedance, the voltage produced by the thermo-junction can be measured
                                accurately.

                            <p>
                                Though the theory and the working of a thermocouple look very simple, it's not easy to
                                convert voltage generated by a thermocouple to a precise temperature reading, because
                                the voltage signal is small. The voltage and temperature reading is non-linear, other
                                than that you need different compensations and conditioning circuits to reduce the
                                environment and radio noise picked up by the long wire of the thermocouple. With this
                                little description, you can understand the difficulty of measuring temperature with a
                                thermocouple.

                            <p>
                                A thermistor is a resistance thermometer, or a resistor whose resistance is dependent on
                                temperature. The term is a combination of “thermal” and “resistor”. It is made of
                                metallic oxides, pressed into a bead, disk, or cylindrical shape and then encapsulated
                                with an impermeable material such as epoxy or glass.<br>There are two types of
                                thermistors: Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) and Positive Temperature Coefficient
                                (PTC). With an NTC thermistor, when the temperature increases, resistance decreases.
                                Conversely, when temperature decreases, resistance increases. This type of thermistor is
                                used the most.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                A PTC thermistor works a little differently. When temperature increases, the resistance
                                increases, and when temperature decreases, resistance decreases. This type of thermistor
                                is generally used as a fuse. <br>Typically, a thermistor achieves high precision within
                                a limited temperature range of about 50ºC around the target temperature. This range is
                                dependent on the base resistance.

                            <h2>Working Principle of Thermistors</h2>
                            <p>
                                The thermistor works on the simple principle of change in resistance due to a change in
                                temperature. When the ambient temperature changes the thermistor starts self-heating its
                                elements. its resistance value is changed with respect to this change in temperature.
                                This change depends on the type of thermistor used. The resistance temperature
                                characteristics of different types of thermistors are given in the following
                                section.<br><br>A thermistor is similar to an RTD, but a semiconductor material is used
                                instead of a metal. A thermistor is a solid state device and has larger sensitivity than
                                does an RTD. Unlike RTD’s, the temperature-resistance characteristic of a thermistor is
                                non-linear, and cannot be characterized by a single coefficient. Furthermore, unlike
                                RTDs, the resistance of a thermistor decreases with increasing temperature.

                                A two wire temperature transmitter accept a thermocouple or RTD input and convert
                                temperature output into 4-20mA current signal. The Transmitter usually requires a 24VDC
                                supply which is connected in series with two wire interface or provided by the host
                                instruments. The amplified temperature signal can be transmitted via long cable run if
                                required.
