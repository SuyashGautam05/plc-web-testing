                    <h2>What is an Encoder?</h2>
                    <p>
                        An encoder is an electromechanical device that converts motion into electrical signals for
                        measurement, monitoring, and controlling the position, speed, and direction of the rotor. It
                        provides real-time feedback on parameters such as position, speed and direction, which enables
                        precise motion control in various systems. Encoders are commonly used in automation, robotics,
                        CNC machines, and motor control systems.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Types of Encoders</h2>
                    <p>
                        Encoders are devices that convert motion into electrical signals for position, speed, or
                        direction control. They are classified into several types based on their working principles and
                        output signals. Here are the main types of encoders:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Optical Encoder: </b>
                            <p>
                                An optical encoder is a sensing device that uses light to convert a shaft or axle’s
                                angular
                                position or motion to a digital code. It is a type of rotary encoder and is known for
                                its
                                high resolution and accuracy. <br>This encoder works by shining light through a rotating
                                disc (code wheel) that has transparent and opaque sections. As the disc rotates, the
                                light
                                beam is interrupted in patterns read by a photodetector to generate a digital signal.

                            <p>
                                Optical encoders come in two main types: <b>absolute encoders</b> and <b>incremental
                                    encoders</b>.
                                Absolute encoders provide a unique code for each position, while incremental encoders
                                measure relative change. They are often more reliable than mechanical encoders in harsh
                                environments.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Components of Optical Encoder</h2>
                            <p>
                                An optical encoder is built with several key components that work in unison to ensure
                                accurate readings:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Light Source: </b> A stable light source, typically an LED, emits a consistent
                                    beam of light. This light is directed toward the code wheel and is essential for
                                    precise signal detection. </li>
                                <li><b>Photodetector: </b> This sensor receives the interrupted light from the code
                                    wheel. It detects light and dark bands and converts these into electrical signals
                                    interpreted as motion data. </li>
                                <li><b>Code Wheel/Disc: </b> The rotating disc is patterned with transparent and opaque
                                    segments. As it spins, it modulates the light beam, enabling the system to detect
                                    direction and speed. </li>
                            </ul>

                                Light emitting device (LED) :Light emitting devices used in optical encoders are
                                generally inexpensive infrared LEDs, but colored LEDs with shorter wavelengths are
                                sometimes used to suppress light diffusion.<br>In addition, expensive laser diodes are
                                used in applications that require high performance and high resolution.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Lens: </b> The light emitted from the LED is diffused light with little
                                    directivity, so that it is made parallel by using a convex lens.</li>
                                <li><b>Code wheel ( movable slit ): </b> The code wheel is a disc with slits ( holes )
                                    for passing/blocking the light emitted from the LED.
                                    <br>The material of the code wheel is metal, resin and glass. Metal is strong
                                    robustness against vibration and temperature and humidity and is used in the
                                    industrial field.
                                    <br>Resin is cheap and suitable for mass production and used for consumer
                                    applications.
                                    <br>Glass is used in applications where high precision and high resolution are
                                    required. In addition, a fixed slit may be placed at the position facing the code
                                    wheel in order to clarify the passing / blocking of the light that passes through
                                    the code wheel and enters the light receiving element.

                        <li><b>What is an Incremental Encoder?</b>
                            <p>
                                An incremental encoder is an electromechanical device that converts rotational or linear
                                motion into electrical signals to determine the speed direction and position of the
                                rotor. Unlike other encoders, which provide a unique value for each position,
                                incremental encoders generate pulses relative to a reference point. <br>The incremental
                                encoder consists of a rotating disk with evenly spaced transparent and opaque sections.
                                As the disk rotates, an optical or magnetic sensor detects these patterns, producing a
                                series of pulses. This series of pulses is counted by the controller to determine the
                                motion of the rotor.

                                they are 90° out of phase. It allows for direction-sensing in the following manner:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If A leads B, the motion is in one direction.</li>
                                <li>If the B leads A, the motion is in the opposite direction.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>A third signal, Z (Index Signal) is generated once per revolution to indicate a reference
                                position. </p>
                            <p>
                                Incremental encoders offer several advantages such as high resolution, accuracy and cost
                                effectiveness. These encoders provide real-time feedback on speed and direction, which
                                makes them useful in automation and motion control applications.

                            <p>
                                An absolute encoder is a position-sensing device that provides a unique digital signal
                                for each position to ensure precise motion tracking of the rotor. Unlike other encoders,
                                which only generate pulses relative to movement, absolute encoders retain position data
                                even after power loss. <br>Absolute encoders use a rotating disk with multiple tracks,
                                and each track represents a binary or gray code pattern. Optical magnetic sensors read
                                these patterns, and the microcontroller interprets the data to determine the exact
                                position. Since each position has a unique code, there is no need for an external
                                counter or reference point.

                                Absolute encoders are available in single-turn and multi-turn variants. The single-turn
                                encoder provides position data within one full rotation but resets after completing
                                360°. In contrast, multi-turn encoders track position across multiple rotations using an
                                internal counter which makes them ideal for complex motion control applications.

                                expensive and complex than incremental encoders and require higher processing power for
                                data interpretation.<br><br>Absolute encoders are widely used in robotics, industrial

                    </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Input Scan:</strong> The PLC reads the status of all input devices</li>
                        <li><strong>Program Execution:</strong> The processor executes the control program based on
                            current inputs and stored data</li>
                        <li><strong>Output Update:</strong> The PLC sends the results to output devices (solenoids,
                            motors, lights, etc.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Housekeeping:</strong> The PLC performs diagnostics and prepares for the next cycle
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="margin-top: 25px;">
                        The entire cycle typically occurs in milliseconds, making PLCs suitable for real-time industrial
                        automation and control applications. Modern PLCs are integral to industrial IoT and Industry 4.0
                        initiatives, enabling seamless integration with cloud-based monitoring and data analytics
                        systems.
