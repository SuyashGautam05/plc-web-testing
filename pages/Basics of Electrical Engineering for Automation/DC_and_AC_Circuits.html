                    <h2>DC Circuits and AC Circuits</h2>
                    <p>
                        AC and DC circuits form the backbone of electrical and automation systems. Almost every
                        industrial automation setup uses a combination of both alternating current (AC) and direct
                        current (DC) circuits to perform different functions. Understanding the characteristics,
                        behavior, and applications of AC and DC circuits is essential for automation engineers, as it
                        helps in system design, component selection, troubleshooting, and safe operation of industrial
                        equipment.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Direct Current (DC) Circuits</h2>
                    <p>
                        In a DC circuit, electric current flows in only one direction with constant polarity. The
                        voltage level remains steady over time, making DC power highly suitable for electronic and
                        control applications. DC circuits are widely used in automation because of their stability,
                        safety, and compatibility with digital and electronic devices.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Key characteristics of DC circuits: </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Current flows in a single direction.</li>
                        <li>Voltage remains constant.</li>
                        <li>Polarity does not change.</li>
                        <li>Easy to control and regulate.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>In industrial automation systems, DC power is mainly used for: </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>PLC input and output modules.</li>
                        <li>Sensors such as proximity, photoelectric, and temperature sensors.</li>
                        <li>Relays, solenoid valves, and control circuits.</li>
                        <li>Electronic control units and communication modules.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The most commonly used DC voltage in industry is <b>24 V DC,</b> as it offers a good balance
                        between
                        operational reliability and personnel safety. DC circuits are also easier to analyze and
                        troubleshoot, making them ideal for control-level applications.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Alternating Current (AC) Circuits</h2>
                    <p>
                        In an AC circuit, the direction of current flow changes periodically. The voltage polarity
                        alternates in a sinusoidal waveform, typically at a frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz, depending on
                        the country. AC power is the primary source of electrical energy in industrial environments due
                        to its efficiency in transmission and ability to handle high-power loads.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Current changes direction periodically.</li>
                        <li>Voltage varies with time.</li>
                        <li>Frequency is fixed by the power supply.</li>
                        <li>Suitable for high-power applications.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>AC circuits are extensively used for:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Industrial motors and drives.</li>
                        <li>Heating systems.</li>
                        <li>Compressors, pumps, and conveyors.</li>
                        <li>Power distribution in factories.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        One major advantage of AC power is that its voltage can be easily stepped up or down using
                        transformers. This makes AC systems highly efficient for long-distance transmission and
                        industrial power distribution.
