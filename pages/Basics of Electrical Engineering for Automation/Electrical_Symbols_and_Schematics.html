                    <h2>Electrical Symbols</h2>
                    <p>
                        Electrical symbols are standardized graphical representations used to denote electrical
                        components in diagrams and drawings. They simplify the understanding of complex electrical
                        circuits by providing a universal visual language. Common symbols represent components such as
                        resistors, capacitors, switches, relays, motors, transformers, circuit breakers, fuses, sensors,
                        and grounding points. Standardized symbols help engineers, technicians, and electricians
                        correctly interpret circuit designs and ensure consistency across documentation.

                    <h2>Electrical Schematics</h2>
                    <p>
                        Electrical schematics are detailed drawings that show how electrical components are connected
                        and how a circuit operates. They illustrate the flow of current, control logic, and power
                        distribution within a system. In industrial automation, schematics are used for designing,
                        installing, troubleshooting, and maintaining control panels and machinery. Clear and accurate
                        schematics improve safety, reduce wiring errors, simplify maintenance, and ensure compliance
                        with electrical standards.<br>Together, electrical symbols and schematics form the foundation
                        for effective communication, design accuracy, and safe operation in electrical and industrial
                        automation systems.

                    <h2>Types of Electrical Symbols</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are many electrical and circuit symbols that are used internationally around the globe.
                        While they are most of the time standardized, which means that the same electronic symbol is
                        used in different countries but we can still find some international differences in those
                        symbols.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Wire Symbol</h2>
                    <p>
                        A wire symbol is a symbol which denotes a wire present in the electric circuit. There are mainly
                        three types of wire symbols, which are mentioned below.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Electrical Wire: </b> An electrical wire is a single conducting copper wire which is
                            generally a cylindrical, flexible rod or strand of metal through which electric current
                            flows.

                        </li>
                        <li><b>Connected Wire: </b> These are the wires which stay connected in an electric circuit and
                            through which current flows easily. As they work as a medium for the flow of current from
                            one point to another.

                        <li><b>Not Connected Wire: </b> In circuit diagrams sometimes we come across wires which are not
                            connected but are overlapping one another. To show that a hump is created over a wire. The
                            image below shows a ‘not connected’ wire.

                        It can be defined as a reference point in a circuit which is known as the ground and has a
                        voltage of 0 V. There are three types of ground symbols, which are mentioned below:
                    </p>

                            This symbol depicts the source voltage of digital logic ICs, which means that no analog
                            signals are bonded into this reference plane.

                            AND gate gives the value of one only if all the operands are one, and otherwise, it has a
                            value of zero. Whereas, the NAND gate gives the value of zero only if all the operands have
                            a value of one, and otherwise, it has a value of one.
                        </li>

                            OR gate gives the value of one if at least one operand has the value of one, otherwise, it
                            gives the value of zero. Whereas, the NOR gate gives the value of one if all operands have a
                            value of zero and otherwise it has a value of zero.
                        </li>

                            XOR gate is the digital logic gate that gives a true output when the number of true inputs
                            put in it is odd. Whereas, a NOT gate is a logic gate that carries out logical negation.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>XNOR Gate: </b>
                            It is an exclusive NOR gate which is made up by combining the exclusive NOT gate with the exclusive OR gate.
