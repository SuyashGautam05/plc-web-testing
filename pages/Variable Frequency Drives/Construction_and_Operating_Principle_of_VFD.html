                    <h2>Construction and Operating Principle of VFD</h2>
                    <p>
                        A Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) is an electronic device used to control the speed and torque of
                        an AC motor by varying the frequency and voltage of the power supplied to the motor. The
                        construction of a VFD consists of several functional blocks that work together to convert
                        fixed-frequency AC power into variable-frequency AC power suitable for motor speed control.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Main components of a VFD include:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rectifier unit.</li>
                        <li>DC link (DC bus).</li>
                        <li>Inverter unit.</li>
                        <li>Control and protection circuits.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Rectifier Unit</h2>
                    <p>
                        The rectifier unit is the first stage of the VFD. It converts the incoming AC supply into DC
                        power using diode or thyristor-based rectifiers. The rectifier ensures a steady DC output that
                        can be further processed by the drive. This stage isolates the motor from direct mains supply
                        and prepares the power for controlled conversion.
                    </p>
                    <h2>DC Link (DC Bus)</h2>
                    <p>
                        The DC link acts as an energy storage and filtering section. It consists of capacitors and
                        sometimes inductors that smooth the rectified DC voltage. The DC bus eliminates ripples and
                        provides a stable DC voltage to the inverter section. It also helps in absorbing voltage spikes
                        and improving overall drive performance.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Inverter Unit</h2>
                    <p>
                        The inverter unit converts the DC voltage from the DC link into AC voltage with variable
                        frequency and magnitude. It uses high-speed switching devices such as IGBTs or MOSFETs. By
                        controlling the switching pattern, the inverter generates an AC output with the desired
                        frequency and voltage to control motor speed.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Control and Protection Circuits</h2>
                    <p>
                        The control circuit is the brain of the VFD. It controls the inverter switching, monitors motor
                        parameters, and provides protection against faults. Protection functions include overcurrent,
                        overvoltage, overheating, and short-circuit protection. Modern VFDs also include communication
                        interfaces and user control panels.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Operating Principle of VFD</h2>
                    <p>
                        The working principle of a Variable Frequency Drive is based on controlling the frequency and
                        voltage supplied to the motor. The speed of an AC motor is directly proportional to the supply
                        frequency, which is expressed by the relation: <br><br>
                        <b>N = (120 × f) / P</b>
                        <br><br>Where:
                        <br><br><b>N = </b> Motor speed (RPM).
                        <br><br><b>f = </b> Supply frequency (Hz).
                        <br><br><b>P = </b> Number of motor poles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By varying the frequency of the supply, the motor speed can be controlled. However, simply
                        changing frequency is not sufficient. To maintain proper motor torque and avoid overheating, the
                        supply voltage must also be adjusted proportionally with frequency. This concept is known as V/f
                        control.
                        <br><br> A VFD converts fixed-frequency AC power into variable-frequency AC power using power
                        electronic
                        components. This allows smooth acceleration, deceleration, and precise speed control of the
                        motor.
                    </p>
