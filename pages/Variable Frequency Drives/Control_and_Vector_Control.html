                    <h2>V/f Control and Vector Control</h2>
                    <p>Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) use different control techniques to regulate the speed and
                        torque of AC motors. Among these, V/f control and vector control are the most commonly used
                        methods. Each control technique is selected based on application requirements such as accuracy,
                        torque response, and complexity.
                    </p>
                    <h2>V/f (Voltage-Frequency) Control</h2>
                    <p>
                        V/f control is the simplest and most widely used control method in VFDs. It is based on
                        maintaining a constant ratio between the applied voltage and frequency to keep the motor
                        magnetic flux constant. By varying the frequency and proportionally adjusting the voltage, motor
                        speed can be controlled effectively.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Key features of V/f control include:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Simple control structure.</li>
                        <li>Open-loop operation in most cases.</li>
                        <li>Suitable for constant torque and variable torque applications.</li>
                        <li>Low cost and easy implementation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        V/f control is commonly used in applications such as fans, pumps, and conveyors where high
                        precision is not required.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Vector Control (Field-Oriented Control)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Vector control is an advanced motor control technique that provides independent control of motor
                        torque and flux. It uses mathematical models and real-time feedback to control motor performance
                        more precisely. Vector control offers better dynamic response and higher torque at low speeds
                        compared to V/f control.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Key features of vector control include:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Independent control of torque and flux.</li>
                        <li>High accuracy and fast response.</li>
                        <li>Suitable for dynamic and high-performance applications.</li>
                        <li>Can operate in open-loop or closed-loop mode.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <P>
                        Vector control is widely used in applications requiring precise speed and torque control, such
                        as elevators, cranes, and CNC machines.
