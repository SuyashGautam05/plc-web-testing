                    <!-- <h2>PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)</h2>
                    <p>A programmable Logic Controller(PLC) is a specialized digital computer employed in industrial
                        settings for automation and control. Acting as the central brain of machinery and processes,
                        PLCs receive input from sensors, process the data through programmed logic, and generate output
                        signals to control devices like motors and valves. They use a programming language, often ladder
                        logic, resembling electrical relay diagrams. PLCs are ruggedized for harsh industrial
                        environments and play a crucial role in automating tasks and reducing manufacturing and energy.
                        Their modular design allows scalability, making them versatile components in modern industrial
                        control systems.</p>
