                    <h2>AR and VR</h2>
                    <p>
                        Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are advanced digital technologies that are
                        increasingly being adopted in industrial automation and Industry 5.0 environments. These
                        technologies enhance human interaction with machines, systems, and data by providing immersive
                        and interactive visual experiences. Unlike traditional interfaces such as screens and control
                        panels, AR and VR allow users to visualize complex information intuitively, improving
                        understanding, efficiency, and safety.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Industry 5.0, AR and VR support the human-centric approach by empowering workers with better
                        tools for decision-making, training, maintenance, and collaboration rather than replacing human
                        involvement.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Augmented Reality (AR)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Augmented Reality is a technology that overlays digital information onto the real-world
                        environment in real time. AR enhances the physical world by adding visual elements such as text,
                        images, animations, and 3D models, which are viewed through devices like smart glasses, tablets,
                        or mobile phones.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Concept of Augmented Reality</h2>
                    <p>
                        AR works by combining real-world visuals with computer-generated data. Sensors, cameras, and
                        software identify the physical environment and superimpose relevant digital information on it.
                        This allows users to see both the real system and additional contextual information
                        simultaneously.<br><br>In industrial automation, AR helps operators and engineers interact more
                        effectively with machines and systems while remaining aware of their physical surroundings.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Applications of AR in Industrial Automation</h2>
                    <p>Augmented Reality is widely used in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maintenance and troubleshooting by displaying step-by-step instructions directly on
                            machines.</li>
                        <li>Assembly operations by guiding workers with visual overlays and component identification.
                        </li>
                        <li>Training and skill development using interactive, real-world scenarios.</li>
                        <li>Quality inspection by highlighting defects and tolerance limits.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        AR reduces dependency on manuals and minimizes human error by providing real-time guidance.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Benefits of Augmented Reality</h2>
                    <p>Key benefits of AR include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improved productivity through faster task execution.</li>
                        <li>Reduced downtime during maintenance and repair.</li>
                        <li>Enhanced safety by providing warnings and hazard indicators.</li>
                        <li>Better knowledge transfer and reduced training time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By supporting workers with real-time information, AR strengthens human-machine collaboration.</p>
                    <h2>Virtual Reality (VR)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Virtual Reality is a technology that creates a completely immersive digital environment,
                        allowing users to interact with a simulated world using VR headsets and controllers. Unlike AR,
                        VR fully replaces the real environment with a virtual one.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Concept of Virtual Reality</h2>
                    <p>
                        VR systems generate a simulated environment that mimics real-world systems, machines, or
                        processes. Users can move, interact, and perform tasks in this virtual environment as if they
                        were physically present. VR relies on advanced graphics, motion tracking, and sensory feedback
                        to create realistic experiences.<br><br>In industrial automation, VR is mainly used for
                        simulation, training, and system design.

                    <p>
                        AR and VR play a significant role in Industry 5.0 by enhancing human capabilities rather than
                        replacing them. These technologies support creativity, learning, and problem-solving while
                        ensuring safety and efficiency.

                    <!-- <h2>PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)</h2>
                    <p>A programmable Logic Controller(PLC) is a specialized digital computer employed in industrial
                        settings for automation and control. Acting as the central brain of machinery and processes,
                        PLCs receive input from sensors, process the data through programmed logic, and generate output
                        signals to control devices like motors and valves. They use a programming language, often ladder
                        logic, resembling electrical relay diagrams. PLCs are ruggedized for harsh industrial
                        environments and play a crucial role in automating tasks and reducing manufacturing and energy.
