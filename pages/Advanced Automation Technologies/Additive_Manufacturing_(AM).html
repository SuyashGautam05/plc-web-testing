                    <h2>Additive Manufacturing (AM)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Additive Manufacturing (AM), commonly known as <strong>3D printing,</strong> is an advanced
                        manufacturing
                        technology in which components are produced by adding material layer by layer based on a digital
                        model. Unlike traditional subtractive manufacturing methods that remove material from a solid
                        block, additive manufacturing builds parts only where material is required. This approach
                        enables high design flexibility, reduced material waste, and rapid production of complex
                        geometries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the context of <strong>Industry 5.0,</strong> additive manufacturing plays a crucial role in
                        supporting
                        human-centric, sustainable, and customized production. It enables industries to combine human
                        creativity with digital manufacturing technologies to produce innovative and personalized
                        products efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Concept of Additive Manufacturing</h2>
                    <p>
                        The additive manufacturing process begins with a <strong>digital 3D model,</strong> usually
                        created using
                        Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software. This model is then converted into a format suitable for 3D
                        printing, where it is sliced into thin layers. The additive manufacturing machine follows these
                        instructions to deposit or solidify material layer by layer until the final component is
                        formed.<br><br>Because the process is digitally driven, design changes can be implemented
                        quickly without the need for complex tooling. This makes additive manufacturing highly flexible
                        and suitable for rapid prototyping and small-batch production.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Working Principle of Additive Manufacturing</h2>
                    <p>
                        The working principle of additive manufacturing involves the following steps:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creation of a digital model representing the desired component.</li>
                        <li>Conversion of the model into layer-by-layer instructions.</li>
                        <li>Controlled deposition or solidification of material layer by layer.</li>
                        <li>Final finishing operations such as cleaning, curing, or machining if required.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Each layer bonds with the previous one, resulting in a solid three-dimensional object.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Types of Additive Manufacturing Technologies</h2>
                    <p>
                        Additive manufacturing includes several technologies, each suited to specific materials and
                        applications.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Material Extrusion</h2>
                    <p>Material extrusion is one of the most widely used additive manufacturing techniques, commonly
                        known through processes like Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). In this method, a thermoplastic
                        material is heated until it becomes semi-molten and is then extruded through a nozzle. The
                        nozzle moves according to the programmed path and deposits the material layer by layer to form
                        the desired object.</p>
                    <img style="margin-left: 30px;margin-bottom: 30px; border: 2px solid black; align-self: center;height: auto; width: 528px;border-radius: 20px;"
                        src="../../assets/Material Extrusion.png" alt="Material Extrusion">
                    <p>
                        The material solidifies immediately after extrusion, allowing the next layer to be placed on
                        top. This method is popular because of its simple working principle, low equipment cost, and
                        ease of operation. Material extrusion is mainly used for rapid prototyping, educational
                        purposes, and low-cost manufacturing of plastic components. However, surface finish and
                        dimensional accuracy are lower compared to other advanced methods.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Powder Bed Fusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Powder Bed Fusion is an advanced additive manufacturing technique primarily used for metal and
                        high-performance plastic components. In this process, a thin layer of powdered material is
                        spread evenly over a build platform. A high-energy laser or electron beam then selectively fuses
                        the powder particles according to the digital design.
                    </p>
                    <img style="margin-left: 30px;margin-bottom: 30px; border: 2px solid black; align-self: center;height: auto; width: 528px;border-radius: 20px;"
                        src="../../assets/Powder Bed Fusion.png" alt="Powder Bed Fusion">
                    <img style="margin-left: 30px;margin-bottom: 30px; border: 2px solid black; align-self: center;height: auto; width: 528px;border-radius: 20px;"
                        src="../../assets/Powder Bed Fusion_2.png" alt="Powder Bed Fusion_2">
                    <p>
                        After one layer is fused, the platform lowers slightly, and a new layer of powder is spread.
                        This process continues until the complete part is formed. Powder bed fusion produces components
                        with excellent mechanical strength, high precision, and complex geometries. It is widely used in
                        aerospace, automotive, and medical industries. The process requires controlled environments and
                        is relatively expensive compared to basic 3D printing methods.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Vat Photopolymerization</h2>
                    <p>
                        Vat photopolymerization is a high-precision additive manufacturing process that uses liquid
                        photopolymer resin as the base material. In this method, a light source such as a laser or
                        ultraviolet (UV) light selectively cures the resin layer by layer inside a resin-filled vat.
                    </p>
                    <img style="margin-left: 30px;margin-bottom: 30px; border: 2px solid black; align-self: center;height: auto; width: 528px;border-radius: 20px;"
                        src="../../assets/Vat Photopolymerization.png" alt="Vat Photopolymerization">
                    <p>
                        When exposed to light, the liquid resin hardens to form a solid layer. This process offers very
                        high surface finish, fine details, and excellent dimensional accuracy. Vat photopolymerization
                        is commonly used for producing detailed prototypes, dental models, medical devices, and visual
                        models. However, the materials used are generally more expensive and may require post-curing to
                        achieve full strength.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Binder Jetting</h2>
                    <p>
                        Binder jetting is an additive manufacturing process in which a liquid binding agent is
                        selectively deposited onto a powder bed to bond the particles together. Unlike powder bed
                        fusion, no heat is used during the printing process. After one layer is bonded, a new layer of
                        powder is spread, and the process continues until the part is formed.
                    </p>
                    <img style="margin-left: 30px;margin-bottom: 30px; border: 2px solid black; align-self: center;height: auto; width: 528px;border-radius: 20px;"
                        src="../../assets/Binder Jetting.png" alt="Binder Jetting">
                    <p>
                        The printed part is initially fragile and requires post-processing steps such as curing,
                        sintering, or infiltration to improve strength. Binder jetting is suitable for producing metal,
                        ceramic, and sand components and is widely used in casting molds, tooling, and low-stress metal
                        parts. The process is relatively fast and allows production of large components but offers lower
                        mechanical strength compared to fusion-based methods.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Applications of Additive Manufacturing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Additive manufacturing is widely used in:
