                    <h2>HMI System Components</h2>
                    <p>
                        A <strong>Human Machine Interface (HMI)</strong> system consists of various hardware and
                        software components that
                        allow operators to interact with industrial machines and automation systems. HMI system
                        components work together to display process information, receive operator commands, and
                        communicate with controllers such as PLCs. Proper understanding of HMI components is essential
                        for designing reliable and user-friendly automation systems.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Display Unit</h2>
                    <p>
                        The display unit is the most visible part of an HMI system. It presents real-time process data,
                        alarms, trends, and system status in graphical or textual form. Displays may be LCD, LED, or
                        touchscreen-based and are designed for clear visibility in industrial environments. <br><br>
                        <b>The display unit provides:</b>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Visual representation of machine and process conditions.</li>
                        <li>Graphical screens such as mimic diagrams and dashboards.</li>
                        <li>Alarm and fault indication for quick response.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        A good display design improves operator awareness and reduces errors.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Input Devices</h2>
                    <p>
                        Input devices allow operators to send commands to the automation system. These include
                        touchscreens, push buttons, keypads, and selector switches integrated into the HMI panel.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Input devices are used to:</b>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start and stop machines.</li>
                        <li>Set parameters such as speed or temperature.</li>
                        <li>Acknowledge alarms and warnings.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        They form the primary control interface between humans and machines.
                    </p>
                    <h2>HMI Processor / Controller</h2>
                    <p>
                        The HMI processor is responsible for executing HMI software, processing user inputs, and
                        managing screen navigation. It handles communication with PLCs and other control devices.
                        <br><br> <b>Key roles include:</b>
                    </p>

                        <li>Handling communication protocols.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The processor ensures smooth and responsive HMI operation.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Communication Interface</h2>
                    <p>
                        Communication interfaces connect the HMI to PLCs, drives, sensors, and SCADA systems. These
                        interfaces support industrial protocols such as Modbus, Ethernet/IP, Profibus, and Profinet.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Communication modules enable:</b>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Real-time data exchange.</li>
                        <li>Remote monitoring and control.</li>
                        <li>Integration into industrial networks.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Reliable communication is critical for accurate HMI operation.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Power Supply</h2>
                    <p>
                        The power supply unit provides regulated power to HMI components. It ensures stable operation
                        and protects the system from voltage fluctuations common in industrial environments.
                    </p>
                    <!-- <ul>
                        <li><b>Flexibility: </b> Control logic can be changed by modifying the program instead of
                            rewiring hardware.</li>
                        <li><b>Compact Size: </b> Replaces large relay panels, saving space.</li>

                    <!-- <h2>PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)</h2>
                    <p>A programmable Logic Controller(PLC) is a specialized digital computer employed in industrial
                        settings for automation and control. Acting as the central brain of machinery and processes,
                        PLCs receive input from sensors, process the data through programmed logic, and generate output
                        signals to control devices like motors and valves. They use a programming language, often ladder
                        logic, resembling electrical relay diagrams. PLCs are ruggedized for harsh industrial
                        environments and play a crucial role in automating tasks and reducing manufacturing and energy.
                        Their modular design allows scalability, making them versatile components in modern industrial
                        control systems.</p>
