                    <h2>Set and Reset Coils</h2>
                    <p>
                        Set and Reset coils are special types of output instructions used in Programmable Logic
                        Controllers (PLCs) to control outputs or internal memory bits in a latched manner. Unlike normal
                        output coils that depend continuously on the logic condition, set and reset coils allow an
                        output to remain ON or OFF even after the controlling condition is removed. This feature is
                        extremely useful in industrial automation where memory of a previous event is
                        required.<br><br>Set and reset coils are widely used in start-stop control circuits, sequence
                        control, safety logic, and machine operation states.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Set Coil (SET Instruction)</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Set coil is used to turn ON (energize) an output or internal memory bit and keep it ON even
                        after the input condition becomes false.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Working of Set Coil</h2>
                    <p>
                        When the logic condition connected to the set coil becomes true:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The set coil energizes the specified output or memory bit.</li>
                        <li>The output remains ON even if the input condition turns OFF.</li>
                        <li>The output stays ON until a reset instruction is executed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The set coil is mainly used where an output must remain active after a momentary input, such as
                        a start push button.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Key Characteristics of Set Coil</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provides memory (latched operation).</li>
                        <li>Output does not depend on continuous input.</li>
                        <li>Used for maintaining machine states.</li>
                        <li>Requires a reset instruction to turn OFF.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Reset Coil (RESET Instruction)</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Reset coil is used to turn OFF (de-energize) an output or internal memory bit that was
                        previously set using a set coil.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Working of Reset Coil</h2>
                    <p>When the logic condition connected to the reset coil becomes true:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The reset coil clears the specified output or memory bit.</li>
                        <li>The output turns OFF immediately.</li>
                        <li>The output remains OFF until it is set again.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Reset coils are commonly used with stop buttons, fault signals, or emergency conditions.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Key Characteristics of Reset Coil</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clears a previously set output.</li>
                        <li>Overrides the set condition.</li>
                        <li>Ensures safe shutdown of machines.</li>
                        <li>Essential for stop and fault logic.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Set-Reset Operation in PLC Logic</h2>
                    <p>
                        Set and reset coils always work together. The same output or memory address is used for both set
                        and reset instructions.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Typical operation:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>SET coil → </b> Turns output ON.</li>
                        <li><b>RESET coil → </b> Turns output OFF.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Example: </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start push button → SET motor output</li>
                        <li>Stop push button → RESET motor output</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This logic ensures controlled and predictable operation of machines.</p>
                    <!-- <ul>
                        <li><b>Flexibility: </b> Control logic can be changed by modifying the program instead of
                            rewiring hardware.</li>
                        <li><b>Compact Size: </b> Replaces large relay panels, saving space.</li>
                        <li><b>High Reliability: </b> Solid-state components reduce mechanical wear and failure.</li>
                        <li><b>Easy Troubleshooting: </b> Diagnostic tools and status indicators simplify fault
                            detection.</li>
                        <li><b>Reduced Maintenance: </b> Quick response time compared to electromechanical relays.</li>
                        <li><b>Faster Operation: </b> bottling, filling, and labeling processes.</li>
                        <li><b>Scalability : </b> Easy expansion of inputs and outputs.</li>
