                    <h2>Ladder Diagram (LD)</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Ladder Diagram (LD) is one of the most widely used and fundamental PLC programming languages
                        in industrial automation. It is a graphical programming language that represents control logic
                        in a form similar to traditional electrical relay logic diagrams. Due to its simplicity,
                        readability, and close resemblance to electrical schematics, Ladder Diagram is especially
                        popular among electrical engineers and technicians.<br><br>Ladder Diagram programming is
                        standardized under IEC 61131-3 and is commonly used for discrete control applications such as
                        motor control, interlocking, sequencing, and safety logic.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Concept of Ladder Diagram</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Ladder Diagram is based on the concept of a ladder, where two vertical lines represent power
                        rails and horizontal lines represent rungs. Each rung contains logical conditions and output
                        actions that are evaluated by the PLC.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The left vertical line represents the power supply or logic TRUE condition.</li>
                        <li>The right vertical line represents the return path or logic FALSE condition.</li>
                        <li>The horizontal rungs contain input conditions and output instructions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The PLC evaluates each rung from left to right and from top to bottom, similar to reading a
                        ladder.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Contacts: </b> Contacts represent input conditions or internal logic states in the PLC
                            program.
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Normally Open (NO) Contact: </b> Represents an input that is FALSE when inactive
                                    and becomes TRUE when activated.</li>
                                <li><b>Normally Closed (NC) Contact: </b> Represents an input that is TRUE when inactive
                                    and becomes FALSE when activated.</li>
                            </ul>
                            Contacts do not physically open or close; they only represent the logical status of inputs,
                            outputs, or internal memory bits.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Coils: </b> Coils represent output actions in a Ladder Diagram.
                            <ul>
                                <li>When the logic on the left side of the rung becomes TRUE, the coil is energized.
                                </li>
                                <li>Energizing a coil sets the corresponding output or internal memory bit to TRUE.</li>
                            </ul>
                            Coils are used to control physical output devices such as motors, solenoid valves, relays,
                            and indicators.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Working of Ladder Diagram</h2>
                    <p>
                        During the PLC scan cycle, the Ladder Diagram program is executed rung by rung.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The PLC reads all input signals and stores their status in memory.</li>
                        <li>The Ladder Diagram logic is executed using these stored input values.</li>
                        <li>If all conditions in a rung are TRUE, the output coil at the end of the rung is energized.
                        </li>
                        <li>Output results are stored in the output image table and updated at the end of the scan
                            cycle.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        This process repeats continuously, allowing real-time control of industrial processes.
                    </p>
