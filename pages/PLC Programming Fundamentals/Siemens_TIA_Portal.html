                    <p>
                        TIA Portal (Totally Integrated Automation Portal) is an integrated engineering software
                        developed by Siemens for programming, configuring, monitoring, and maintaining automation
                        systems. It provides a unified platform for working with PLCs, HMIs, drives, and other
                        automation components within a single software environment. TIA Portal is widely used in
                        industrial automation due to its user-friendly interface, powerful features, and seamless
                        integration of hardware and software.<br><br>TIA Portal supports Siemens PLCs such as SIMATIC
                        S7-1200, S7-1500, and earlier series, and allows engineers to design, test, and commission
                        automation projects efficiently. By using a single engineering framework, TIA Portal reduces
                        development time and improves consistency across automation projects.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Features of TIA Portal</h2>
                    <p>

                    <h2>PLC Programming Using TIA Portal</h2>
                    <p>
                        In TIA Portal, PLC programming is performed by creating a project and adding the required PLC
                        hardware configuration. The user then creates program blocks such as Organization Blocks (OBs),
                        Function Blocks (FBs), Functions (FCs), and Data Blocks (DBs).<br><br>The control logic is
                        written using graphical or text-based programming languages supported by TIA Portal. Online
                        monitoring allows the programmer to observe real-time status of inputs, outputs, variables, and
                        program execution, which helps in debugging and optimization.<br><br>TIA Portal also provides
                        extensive libraries that contain predefined function blocks and reusable code, improving
                        programming efficiency and standardization.

                    <!-- <h2>PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)</h2>
                    <p>A programmable Logic Controller(PLC) is a specialized digital computer employed in industrial
                        settings for automation and control. Acting as the central brain of machinery and processes,
                        PLCs receive input from sensors, process the data through programmed logic, and generate output
                        signals to control devices like motors and valves. They use a programming language, often ladder
                        logic, resembling electrical relay diagrams. PLCs are ruggedized for harsh industrial
                        environments and play a crucial role in automating tasks and reducing manufacturing and energy.
                        Their modular design allows scalability, making them versatile components in modern industrial
                        control systems.</p>
