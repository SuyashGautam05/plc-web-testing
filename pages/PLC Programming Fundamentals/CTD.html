                        The <strong>CTD (Count Down)</strong> counter decreases its count value each time the input
                        condition changes from FALSE to TRUE. The counter starts counting down from a preset value
                        toward zero.<br><br>When the count reaches zero, the counter output becomes TRUE, indicating
                        that the countdown is complete. A reset instruction is required to reload the preset value and
                        restart the counting process.<br><br>CTD counters are used in applications such as batch
                        processing, countdown operations, and control systems where a fixed number of operations must be
                        completed.

                    <!-- <h2>PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)</h2>
                    <p>A programmable Logic Controller(PLC) is a specialized digital computer employed in industrial
                        settings for automation and control. Acting as the central brain of machinery and processes,
                        PLCs receive input from sensors, process the data through programmed logic, and generate output
                        signals to control devices like motors and valves. They use a programming language, often ladder
                        logic, resembling electrical relay diagrams. PLCs are ruggedized for harsh industrial
                        environments and play a crucial role in automating tasks and reducing manufacturing and energy.
                        Their modular design allows scalability, making them versatile components in modern industrial
                        control systems.</p>

                    <h2>Where Can PLC Be Used?</h2>
                    <p>
                        PLCs play a pivotal role in industrial automation, efficiently managing machinery and processes.
                        They receive data from sensors, execute programmed logic, and control actuators, enhancing
                        precision and reducing manual intervention. PLCs find application across diverse industries,
                        from manufacturing to utilities, ensuring streamlined operations, increased productivity, and
                        adaptability to evolving production needs. Their robust capabilities make PLCs indispensable in
                        modern industrial settings, facilities with seamless control and automation for improved
                        efficiency and reliability.
