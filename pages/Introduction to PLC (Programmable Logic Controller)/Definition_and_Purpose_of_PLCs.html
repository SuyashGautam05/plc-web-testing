                    <h2>PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)</h2>
                    <p>
                        A programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is a specialized digital computer employed in industrial
                        settings for automation and control. Acting as the central brain of machinery and processes,
                        PLCs receive input from sensors, process the data through programmed logic, and generate output
                        signals to control devices like motors and valves. They use a programming language, often ladder
                        logic, resembling electrical relay diagrams. PLCs are ruggedized for harsh industrial
                        environments and play a crucial role in automating tasks and reducing manufacturing and energy.
                        Their modular design allows scalability, making them versatile components in modern industrial
                        control systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        PLCs receive input signals from field devices such as sensors, switches, and push buttons. Based
                        on the programmed logic, they process these inputs and generate output signals to control
                        actuators such as motors, relays, solenoids, and valves.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Purpose of PLCs</h2>
                    <p>The primary purpose of PLCs is to replace traditional relay-based control systems with a more
                        efficient, flexible, and reliable control solution. PLCs simplify complex control tasks and
                        allow easy modification of control logic without changing physical wiring.</p>
                    <p><b>PLCs are used to:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Automate industrial machines and processes.</li>
                        <li>Improve operational efficiency and productivity.</li>
                        <li>Reduce wiring complexity and panel space.</li>
                        <li>Increase system reliability and repeatability.</li>
                        <li>Enable easy troubleshooting and maintenance</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li><b>Compact Size: </b> Replaces large relay panels, saving space.</li>
                        <li><b>High Reliability: </b> Solid-state components reduce mechanical wear and failure.</li>
                        <li><b>Easy Troubleshooting: </b> Diagnostic tools and status indicators simplify fault
                            detection.</li>
                        <li><b>Reduced Maintenance: </b> Quick response time compared to electromechanical relays.</li>
                        <li><b>Faster Operation: </b> bottling, filling, and labeling processes.</li>
                        <li><b>Scalability : </b> Easy expansion of inputs and outputs.</li>
