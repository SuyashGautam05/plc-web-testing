                    <h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the most important component of a PLC system and is often
                        referred to as the brain of the PLC. It is responsible for executing the control program,
                        processing input data, controlling output actions, and managing communication with other
                        devices. The overall performance, speed, and capability of a PLC system largely depend on the
                        CPU.<br><br>The CPU operates by continuously performing a sequence known as the PLC scan cycle.
                        During this cycle, the CPU first reads the status of all input modules and stores their values
                        in memory. It then executes the user-defined control logic instruction by instruction. After
                        program execution, the CPU updates the output modules according to the logic results. This cycle
                        repeats continuously as long as the PLC is in operation, ensuring real-time control.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Major functions of the CPU include</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Execution of logic, arithmetic, timing, and counting operations.</li>
                        <li>Management of memory and data handling.</li>
                        <li>Monitoring system health and detecting faults.</li>
                        <li>Handling communication with I/O modules, HMIs, SCADA, and networks.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Modern PLC CPUs also include advanced features such as self-diagnostics, watchdog timers,
                        real-time clocks, and data logging capabilities. In complex automation systems, high-speed CPUs
                        are essential to ensure fast response and accurate control.</p>

                        <li><b>Flexibility: </b> Control logic can be changed by modifying the program instead of
                            rewiring hardware.</li>
                        <li><b>Compact Size: </b> Replaces large relay panels, saving space.</li>
                        <li><b>High Reliability: </b> Solid-state components reduce mechanical wear and failure.</li>

                            detection.</li>
                        <li><b>Reduced Maintenance: </b> Quick response time compared to electromechanical relays.</li>
                        <li><b>Faster Operation: </b> bottling, filling, and labeling processes.</li>
                        <li><b>Scalability : </b> Easy expansion of inputs and outputs.</li>

                    <!-- <h2>PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)</h2>
                    <p>A programmable Logic Controller(PLC) is a specialized digital computer employed in industrial
                        settings for automation and control. Acting as the central brain of machinery and processes,
                        PLCs receive input from sensors, process the data through programmed logic, and generate output
                        signals to control devices like motors and valves. They use a programming language, often ladder
                        logic, resembling electrical relay diagrams. PLCs are ruggedized for harsh industrial
                        environments and play a crucial role in automating tasks and reducing manufacturing and energy.
                        Their modular design allows scalability, making them versatile components in modern industrial
                        control systems.</p>
