                    <h2>Circuit Breakers and Fuses</h2>
                    <p>
                        Circuit breakers and fuses are critical protective devices used in industrial electrical and
                        automation systems. Their primary function is to protect electrical circuits, equipment, and
                        personnel from damage caused by abnormal conditions such as overloads, short circuits, and
                        faults. By interrupting the flow of excessive current, these devices prevent overheating, fire
                        hazards, and equipment failure, thereby ensuring safe and reliable operation of automation
                        systems.

                    <h2>Need for Circuit Protection</h2>
                    <p>
                        Electrical circuits are designed to operate within specific current limits. When these limits
                        are exceeded due to faults or excessive load, serious damage can occur.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Circuit protection is required to:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prevent damage to cables and insulation.</li>
                        <li>Protect motors and control equipment.</li>
                        <li>Reduce risk of fire and electrical accidents.</li>
                        <li>Ensure continuity and reliability of operations.</li>

                            the status of the circuit breaker (On or Off/tripped). Most breakers are designed so they
                            can still trip even if the lever is held or locked in the “on” position. This is sometimes
                            referred to as “free trip” or “positive trip” operation.</li>

                    <h2>What is RCCB?</h2>
                    <p>
                        RCCB is Residual Current Circuit Breaker. This residual current device is basically an
                        electrical wiring device that disconnects the circuit whenever there is leakage of current flow
                        through the Human body or the current is not balanced between the phase-conductor. It is the
                        safest device to detect and trip against electrical leakage currents, thus ensure protection
                        against electric shock caused by direct contacts. RCCB is generally used in series with an MCB
                        which protects them from over current and short circuit current.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What is ELCB?</h2>
                    <p>
                        ELCB stands for Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker. They have the same function as RCCB but are
                        voltage-sensing devices. However, this is an old technology and is not in common use. RCCB,
                        being a current-sensitive device, has a better advantage over ELCB as it detects leakage current
                        directly, operates faster, does not depend on earth resistance, and provides more reliable
                        protection against electric shock and fire hazards.

                    <h2>Fuses</h2>
                    <p>
                        A fuse is a simple protective device that interrupts the circuit when excessive current flows.
                        It consists of a metal element that melts when the current exceeds a predetermined value,
                        thereby breaking the circuit.

                        <li>Reliable and cost-effective protection.</li>
                        <li>Requires replacement after operation.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        While fuses offer reliable protection, their main limitation is that they must be replaced once
                        they operate.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> Provides electrical power to the PLC</li>
                        <li><strong>Processor (CPU):</strong> The brain of the PLC that executes the program</li>
                        <li><strong>Memory:</strong> Stores the program and operational data</li>
                        <li><strong>Input Modules:</strong> Receive signals from sensors and switches</li>
                        <li><strong>Output Modules:</strong> Send control signals to actuators and motors</li>
                        <li><strong>Communication Module:</strong> Enables communication with other devices and systems
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: var(--text-color);">Basic Operating Cycle:
                    </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Input Scan:</strong> The PLC reads the status of all input devices</li>
                        <li><strong>Program Execution:</strong> The processor executes the control program based on
                            current inputs and stored data</li>
                        <li><strong>Output Update:</strong> The PLC sends the results to output devices (solenoids,
                            motors, lights, etc.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Housekeeping:</strong> The PLC performs diagnostics and prepares for the next cycle
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="margin-top: 25px;">
                        The entire cycle typically occurs in milliseconds, making PLCs suitable for real-time industrial
                        automation and control applications. Modern PLCs are integral to industrial IoT and Industry 4.0
                        initiatives, enabling seamless integration with cloud-based monitoring and data analytics
                        systems.
