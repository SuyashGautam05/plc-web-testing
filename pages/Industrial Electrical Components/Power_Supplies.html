                    <h2>Introduction to Power Supplies</h2>
                    <p>
                        A power supply is an electrical device that converts electrical energy from one form to another
                        to meet the requirements of connected loads. In industrial automation systems, power supplies
                        are primarily used to convert high-voltage AC power into low-voltage, regulated DC power
                        required by control devices such as PLCs, sensors, relays, HMIs, and communication modules.
                        <br><br>
                        Reliable power supply operation is crucial because automation systems heavily depend on stable
                        voltage levels. Even small voltage fluctuations can cause malfunction, data loss, or damage to
                        sensitive electronic components.

                    <h2>Types of Power Supplies Used in Automation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Industrial automation commonly uses the following types of power supplies:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>AC to DC Power Supplies: </b> Convert mains AC voltage (230 V or 415 V) into DC voltages
                            such as 24 V, 12 V, or 5 V.</li>
                        <li><b>Switched Mode Power Supplies (SMPS): </b> Widely used due to their high efficiency,
                            compact size, and ability to handle wide input voltage ranges.</li>
                        <li><b>Linear Power Supplies: </b> Provide clean output but are less efficient and bulkier; used
                            where low electrical noise is critical.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Among these, <b>24 V DC SMPS</b> is the most commonly used power supply standard in industrial
                        automation.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Importance of Proper Power Supply Selection</h2>
                    <p>
                        Incorrect power supply selection can result in system instability or frequent failures.
                        Selection criteria include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Output voltage and current rating.</li>
                        <li>Total load calculation with safety margin.</li>
                        <li>Input voltage compatibility.</li>
                        <li>Environmental conditions.</li>
                        <li>Compliance with industrial standards.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Proper selection ensures uninterrupted operation and protects sensitive automation equipment.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> Provides electrical power to the PLC</li>
                        <li><strong>Processor (CPU):</strong> The brain of the PLC that executes the program</li>
                        <li><strong>Memory:</strong> Stores the program and operational data</li>
                        <li><strong>Input Modules:</strong> Receive signals from sensors and switches</li>
                        <li><strong>Output Modules:</strong> Send control signals to actuators and motors</li>
                        <li><strong>Communication Module:</strong> Enables communication with other devices and systems
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 style="margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px; color: var(--text-color);">Basic Operating Cycle:
                    </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Input Scan:</strong> The PLC reads the status of all input devices</li>
                        <li><strong>Program Execution:</strong> The processor executes the control program based on
                            current inputs and stored data</li>
                        <li><strong>Output Update:</strong> The PLC sends the results to output devices (solenoids,
                            motors, lights, etc.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Housekeeping:</strong> The PLC performs diagnostics and prepares for the next cycle
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="margin-top: 25px;">
                        The entire cycle typically occurs in milliseconds, making PLCs suitable for real-time industrial
                        automation and control applications. Modern PLCs are integral to industrial IoT and Industry 4.0
                        initiatives, enabling seamless integration with cloud-based monitoring and data analytics
                        systems.
