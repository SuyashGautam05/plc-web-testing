                    <h2>Introduction to Distributed Control Systems</h2>
                    <p>
                        A Distributed Control System (DCS) is an advanced control system used in industrial automation
                        where control functions are distributed across multiple controllers located near the process
                        equipment, rather than being centralized in a single control unit. DCS is designed to manage
                        complex, large-scale, and continuous industrial processes with high reliability, safety, and
                        flexibility. It is widely used in process industries where uninterrupted operation and precise
                        control are critical.<br><br>Unlike conventional centralized control systems, a DCS distributes
                        control intelligence throughout the plant. Each local controller performs control tasks for a
                        specific section of the process, while a central supervisory system provides monitoring,
                        coordination, and data management. This distributed architecture improves system reliability and
                        scalability.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Key objectives of a Distributed Control System include:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reliable and continuous process control.</li>
                        <li>Improved system availability and fault tolerance.</li>
                        <li>Reduced wiring and installation complexity.</li>
                        <li>Centralized monitoring with distributed control.</li>
                        <li>Easy system expansion and modification.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Basic Concept of DCS</h2>
                    <p>
                        The fundamental concept of DCS is to place control units close to the process being controlled.
                        Sensors and actuators are connected to local controllers, which execute control algorithms
                        independently. These controllers communicate with operator stations and engineering stations
                        through high-speed industrial communication networks.<br><br>This approach ensures that even if
                        part of the system fails, other sections of the plant can continue to operate safely. It also
                        reduces the impact of communication delays and improves response time.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Main Features of DCS</h2>
                    <p>
                        Distributed Control Systems are characterized by the following features:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Multiple distributed controllers performing local control.</li>
                        <li>Redundant hardware and communication networks.</li>
                        <li>Centralized operator interface for supervision.</li>
                        <li>Integrated alarm, trend, and data management.</li>
                        <li>High system reliability and availability.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These features make DCS suitable for mission-critical industrial applications.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Role of DCS in Industrial Automation</h2>
                    <p>
                        DCS plays a vital role in modern industrial automation by enabling precise and coordinated
                        control of complex processes. It supports continuous operation, real-time monitoring, and
                        advanced control strategies. DCS also integrates easily with higher-level systems such as SCADA,
                        Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), and enterprise networks.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Input Scan:</strong> The PLC reads the status of all input devices</li>
                        <li><strong>Program Execution:</strong> The processor executes the control program based on
                            current inputs and stored data</li>
                        <li><strong>Output Update:</strong> The PLC sends the results to output devices (solenoids,
                            motors, lights, etc.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Housekeeping:</strong> The PLC performs diagnostics and prepares for the next cycle
                        </li>

                    <p style="margin-top: 25px;">
                        The entire cycle typically occurs in milliseconds, making PLCs suitable for real-time industrial
                        automation and control applications. Modern PLCs are integral to industrial IoT and Industry 4.0
                        initiatives, enabling seamless integration with cloud-based monitoring and data analytics
                        systems.
