                    <h2>DCS Architecture and Components</h2>
                    <p>
                        The architecture of a Distributed Control System is designed to handle large volumes of data and
                        control tasks efficiently. It consists of multiple layers, each performing a specific function.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Main layers of DCS architecture include:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Field level.</li>
                        <li>Control level.</li>
                        <li>Supervisory level.</li>
                        <li>Engineering level.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Field Level: </b> The field level consists of sensors, transmitters, and actuators
                            directly connected to the industrial process. These devices measure process variables such
                            as temperature, pressure, flow, and level, and perform control actions such as opening
                            valves or starting motors. Field devices provide real-time process data to the control
                            system and execute commands received from controllers.</li>
                        <li><b>Control level: </b> The control level contains distributed controllers or process control
                            units. These controllers execute control algorithms such as PID control, logic control, and
                            sequencing. Each controller is responsible for a specific section of the plant, allowing
                            local control even if communication with higher levels is interrupted. This level forms the
                            core of the DCS.</li>
                        <li><b>Supervisory level: </b> The supervisory level includes operator workstations and servers
                            used for monitoring and supervisory control. Operators view real-time process data, alarms,
                            and trends through graphical displays. Supervisory systems coordinate overall plant
                            operation and provide centralized visibility without directly handling low-level control
                            tasks.</li>
                        <li><b>Engineering level: </b> The engineering level is used for system configuration,
                            programming, and maintenance. Engineers design control logic, configure alarms, and manage
                            system databases from engineering stations. Changes made at this level are downloaded to
                            controllers without disturbing plant operation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Components of a DCS</h2>
                    <p>A Distributed Control System consists of several key components that work together to ensure
                        effective process control.</p>
                    <p><b>Major components of a DCS include:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Field instruments.</li>
                        <li>Distributed controllers.</li>
                        <li>Input/Output (I/O) modules.</li>
                        <li>Operator stations.</li>
                        <li>Engineering stations.</li>
                        <li>Communication network.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Field instruments: </b> Field instruments include sensors, transmitters, and actuators
                            installed at the process site. They provide accurate measurement of process variables and
                            enable physical control of the process. These instruments form the interface between the
                            physical process and the control system.</li>
                        <li><b>Distributed controllers: </b> Distributed controllers are intelligent control units
                            placed close to the process. They execute control algorithms independently and handle
                            real-time control tasks. The distributed nature of these controllers increases system
                            reliability and reduces dependency on a single control unit.</li>
                        <li><b>Input/Output (I/O) modules: </b> I/O modules interface field instruments with distributed
                            controllers. They convert field signals into digital data and vice versa. I/O modules
                            support both digital and analog signals and provide electrical isolation to protect system
                            components.</li>
                        <li><b>Operator stations: </b> Operator stations provide the Human Machine Interface (HMI) for
                            the DCS. They display process graphics, alarms, trends, and reports. Operators use these
                            stations to monitor plant operation and issue supervisory commands.</li>
                        <li><b>Engineering stations: </b> Engineering stations are used for system configuration,
                            programming, and maintenance. They allow engineers to design control strategies, configure
                            system parameters, and troubleshoot faults. These stations play a critical role during
                            system commissioning and upgrades.</li>
                        <li><b>Communication network: </b> The communication network connects all DCS components. It
                            enables data exchange between controllers, operator stations, and engineering stations.
                            High-speed and redundant communication networks ensure reliable and uninterrupted operation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <!-- <ul>
                        <li><b>Flexibility: </b> Control logic can be changed by modifying the program instead of
                            rewiring hardware.</li>
                        <li><b>Compact Size: </b> Replaces large relay panels, saving space.</li>
                        <li><b>High Reliability: </b> Solid-state components reduce mechanical wear and failure.</li>
                        <li><b>Easy Troubleshooting: </b> Diagnostic tools and status indicators simplify fault
                            detection.</li>
                        <li><b>Reduced Maintenance: </b> Quick response time compared to electromechanical relays.</li>
                        <li><b>Faster Operation: </b> bottling, filling, and labeling processes.</li>
                        <li><b>Scalability : </b> Easy expansion of inputs and outputs.</li>
                    </ul> -->

                        settings for automation and control. Acting as the central brain of machinery and processes,
                        PLCs receive input from sensors, process the data through programmed logic, and generate output
                        signals to control devices like motors and valves. They use a programming language, often ladder
                        logic, resembling electrical relay diagrams. PLCs are ruggedized for harsh industrial
                        environments and play a crucial role in automating tasks and reducing manufacturing and energy.
