                    <p>A wide range of tools are required for industrial automation. They include various control
                        systems that incorporate different devices and systems impacting aspects of the manufacturing
                        process. The key tools are explained here.</p>


                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Programmable Logic Controller (PLC): </b> A PLC is a ruggedized, industrial programmable
                            logic controller, that is preprogrammed to carry out automatic operations in industrial
                            processes. The PLC continuously monitors and receives information from input devices or
                            sensors, processes the information, and triggers the connected output devices, to complete
                            the task in the industrial process or machinery.</li>

                        <li><b>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA): </b> SCADA systems control and monitor
                            industrial processes. The system acquires and processes real-time data through direct
                            interaction with devices, such as sensors and PLCs, and records events into a log file.
                            SCADA is important for data analysis, and enables effective decision-making for optimization
                            in industrial processes.</li>

                            system. It translates complex data into accessible information, enabling better control of

                            human brain, a network of interconnected neuron nodes. ANNs simulate the way a human brain
                            analyzes and processes information.</li>

                        logic, resembling electrical relay diagrams. PLCs are ruggedized for harsh industrial
                        environments and play a crucial role in automating tasks and reducing manufacturing and energy.
                        Their modular design allows scalability, making them versatile components in modern industrial
                        control systems.</p>
