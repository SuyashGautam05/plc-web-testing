                    <h2>Emergency Stop (E-Stop) Systems</h2>
                    <p>
                        Emergency Stop (E-Stop) systems are critical safety mechanisms used in industrial automation to
                        immediately stop machinery during hazardous or abnormal conditions. These systems are designed
                        to protect operators, maintenance personnel, and equipment by rapidly bringing machines to a
                        safe state when normal control methods are insufficient. E-Stop systems are not intended for
                        routine operation but are used only in emergency situations.
                    </p>

                        src="../../assets/Emergency Stop (E-Stop) Systems_1.png" alt="">
                    <h2>Purpose of Emergency Stop Systems</h2>
                    <p>
                        The primary purpose of an E-Stop system is to prevent injury and damage by quickly stopping
                        machine motion. In automated environments, machines may continue operating even when unsafe
                        conditions arise. The E-Stop system provides a direct and reliable method for immediate
                        shutdown.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>E-Stop systems ensure: </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Immediate interruption of machine operation during emergencies.</li>
                        <li>Prevention of further hazards caused by uncontrolled movement.</li>
                        <li>Protection of personnel working near machines.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Working Principle of E-Stop Systems</h2>
                    <p>
                        An E-Stop system operates by interrupting the power or control signal supplied to the machine.
                        When the E-Stop button is pressed, the control circuit opens, causing the machine to stop. The
                        system is designed so that safety has priority over all other control functions.
                        <br>After activation, the system remains in the stop condition until it is manually reset. This
                        prevents accidental restart and ensures that the cause of the emergency is addressed before
                        operation resumes.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Design Features of E-Stop Systems</h2>
                    <p>Emergency Stop systems have specific design characteristics to ensure effectiveness and
                        reliability:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>E-Stop buttons are mushroom-shaped and red in color for easy identification.</li>
                        <li>They are designed to be easily accessible from hazardous areas.</li>
                        <li>The system overrides all automatic and manual controls.</li>
                        <li>Manual reset is required after activation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These features ensure fast response and safe recovery after an emergency.</p>
                    <h2>Applications of E-Stop Systems</h2>
                    <p>Emergency Stop systems are widely used in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Industrial machines and production lines.</li>
                        <li>Conveyor and material handling systems.</li>
                        <li>Robotic and automated workstations.</li>
                        <li>Control panels and operator stations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        They form a mandatory safety requirement in most industrial installations.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Standards and Compliance</h2>
                    <p>
                        E-Stop systems must comply with safety standards such as IEC and ISO, which define requirements
                        for design, placement, and operation. Compliance ensures reliability and legal acceptance of
                        automation systems.

                    <!-- <h2>PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)</h2>
                    <p>A programmable Logic Controller(PLC) is a specialized digital computer employed in industrial
                        settings for automation and control. Acting as the central brain of machinery and processes,
                        PLCs receive input from sensors, process the data through programmed logic, and generate output
                        signals to control devices like motors and valves. They use a programming language, often ladder
                        logic, resembling electrical relay diagrams. PLCs are ruggedized for harsh industrial
                        environments and play a crucial role in automating tasks and reducing manufacturing and energy.
                        Their modular design allows scalability, making them versatile components in modern industrial
