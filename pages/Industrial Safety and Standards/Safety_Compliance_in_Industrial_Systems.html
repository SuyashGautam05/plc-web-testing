                    <h2>Safety Compliance in Industrial Systems</h2>
                    <p>
                        Safety compliance in industrial systems refers to the adherence to established safety standards,
                        regulations, and best practices during the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of
                        industrial equipment and automation systems. Industrial environments involve electrical energy,
                        mechanical motion, high temperatures, and automated processes, all of which pose potential
                        risks. Safety compliance ensures that these risks are minimized and that industrial systems
                        operate in a safe, reliable, and legally acceptable manner.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Importance of Safety Compliance</h2>
                    <p>
                        Safety compliance is essential to protect human life, equipment, and the environment.
                        Non-compliance with safety requirements can lead to accidents, injuries, production losses, and
                        legal consequences.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Safety compliance ensures: </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protection of operators, maintenance staff, and nearby personnel.</li>
                        <li>Prevention of accidents caused by electrical or mechanical hazards.</li>
                        <li>Reduction in equipment damage and system failures.</li>
                        <li>Legal acceptance of industrial installations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A compliant system reflects a responsible and professional approach to industrial operation.</p>
                    <h2>Role of Safety Standards and Regulations</h2>
                    <p>
                        Safety compliance is guided by national and international standards such as IEC, ISO, and
                        occupational safety regulations. These standards define minimum safety requirements for
                        electrical systems, machines, control panels, and automation processes.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Standards help by:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Providing uniform safety guidelines across industries.</li>
                        <li>Defining safe design and installation practices.</li>
                        <li>Ensuring consistent inspection and testing procedures.</li>
                        <li>Supporting global interoperability of industrial systems.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Following recognized standards simplifies audits and regulatory approvals.</p>
                    <h2>Inspection, Testing, and Maintenance</h2>
                    <p>
                        Safety compliance is not a one-time activity. Industrial systems must be regularly inspected and
                        tested to ensure continued safe operation.
                    </p>

                        src="../../assets/Safety Compliance in Industrial Systems_1.png" alt="">
                    <p><b>Compliance activities include:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Periodic safety inspections and audits.</li>
                        <li>Testing of safety circuits and protective devices.</li>
                        <li>Preventive maintenance of safety components.</li>
                        <li>Documentation of inspection and corrective actions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These practices help detect potential hazards early.</p>
                    <h2>Legal and Organizational Responsibility</h2>
                    <p>
                        Industries are legally responsible for ensuring safety compliance. Failure to comply can result
                        in penalties, shutdowns, or legal action. Beyond legal requirements, safety compliance also
                        reflects organizational ethics and commitment to employee welfare.

                    <!-- <h2>PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)</h2>
                    <p>A programmable Logic Controller(PLC) is a specialized digital computer employed in industrial
                        settings for automation and control. Acting as the central brain of machinery and processes,
                        PLCs receive input from sensors, process the data through programmed logic, and generate output
                        signals to control devices like motors and valves. They use a programming language, often ladder
                        logic, resembling electrical relay diagrams. PLCs are ruggedized for harsh industrial
                        environments and play a crucial role in automating tasks and reducing manufacturing and energy.
                        Their modular design allows scalability, making them versatile components in modern industrial
