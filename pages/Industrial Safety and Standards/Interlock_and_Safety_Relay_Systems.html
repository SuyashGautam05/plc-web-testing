                    <h2>Interlock and Safety Relay Systems</h2>
                    <p>
                        Interlock and safety relay systems are essential safety mechanisms used in industrial automation
                        to prevent machines from operating under unsafe conditions. These systems ensure that machinery
                        functions only when predefined safety requirements are met. Unlike emergency stop systems, which
                        react to hazardous situations, interlock and safety relay systems work continuously to prevent
                        hazards from occurring in the first place.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Purpose of Interlock and Safety Relay Systems</h2>

                    </ul>
                    <p>By enforcing safety conditions, interlock systems significantly improve workplace safety.</p>
                    <h2>Interlock Systems</h2>
                    <p>
                        Interlock systems are devices or mechanisms that link the operation of a machine to specific
                        safety conditions. A machine can operate only when these conditions are satisfied. <br>
                        Interlock systems ensure:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Machines do not start unless protective covers are properly closed.</li>
                        <li>Hazardous motion stops immediately if a guard is opened.</li>
                        <li>Operators cannot bypass safety conditions during operation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Interlocks can be mechanical, electrical, or electronic depending on the application.</p>
                    <h2>Types of Interlock Systems</h2>

                    <h2>Working Principle of Safety Relay Systems</h2>
                    <p>
                        Safety relays continuously monitor the status of safety devices. If a fault such as an open
                        guard, pressed E-Stop, or wiring failure occurs, the safety relay immediately de-energizes the
                        output circuit, stopping the machine safely.
                        <br>Manual reset is typically required after fault clearance to prevent accidental restart.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Applications in Industrial Automation</h2>
                    <p>Interlock and safety relay systems are commonly used in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Machine guarding and access control systems.</li>
                        <li>Automated production lines.</li>
                        <li>Robotic cells and conveyor systems.</li>
                        <li>Control panels and safety circuits.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>They are a mandatory part of modern industrial safety design.</p>
                    <h2>Standards and Compliance</h2>
