                    <p>
                        A stepper motor is a brushless synchronous electric motor engineered to convert digital input
                        (pulses) into mechanical rotation. Unlike conventional electric motors, stepper motors divide a
                        full rotation (360°) into a series of equal steps. This results in a step angle of 1.8°, which
                        means each electrical pulse moves the shaft by exactly that amount.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Working Principle of Stepper Motor</h2>
                    <p>
                        The working principle of stepper motor is based on electromagnetic attraction. When the stator
                        coils are energised, they produce a magnetic field that aligns the rotor with the stator pole.
                        By energising stator coils in a specific sequence, the rotor moves incrementally from one
                        position to the next at a specific angle. Each electrical pulse advances the rotor by one step.
                        <br><br>The below stepper motor diagram will help us to visualise how stepper motors work.

                    <p>
                        A Permanent Magnet (PM) Stepper Motor is a type of stepper motor that uses a permanent magnet
                        rotor and produces motion in discrete steps. Unlike conventional motors that rotate
                        continuously, a stepper motor moves in precise angular steps when electrical pulses are applied.
                        This property makes PM stepper motors highly suitable for applications requiring accurate
                        position control without feedback systems.
                        <br><br>Permanent magnet stepper motors are widely used in automation, instrumentation, and
                        control systems due to their simplicity, reliability, and precise control capability.

                    <h2>Construction of Permanent Magnet Stepper Motor</h2>
                    <p>
                        The main components of a permanent magnet stepper motor are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Stator: </b> The stator consists of multiple windings arranged in phases. When energized
                            sequentially, these windings produce a rotating magnetic field.</li>
                        <li><b>Rotor: </b> The rotor is made of a permanent magnet, usually cylindrical, with north and
                            south poles. The rotor aligns itself with the stator’s magnetic field.</li>
                        <li><b>Shaft and Bearings: </b> The shaft is connected to the rotor and transmits mechanical
                            motion, while bearings support smooth rotation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The permanent magnet rotor eliminates the need for rotor windings or external excitation.</p>

                    <h2>Working Principle</h2>
                    <p>
                        The working principle of a permanent magnet stepper motor is based on magnetic attraction and
                        repulsion. When a stator winding is energized, it creates a magnetic field. The permanent magnet
                        rotor aligns itself with this field. As different stator windings are energized in sequence, the
                        rotor moves step by step to align with the new magnetic field position.
                        <br><br>Each input pulse causes the motor to rotate by a fixed angle called the step angle. The
                        direction of rotation depends on the sequence of energizing the stator windings.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Step Angle</h2>
                    <p>
                        The step angle is the angle through which the motor shaft rotates for each input pulse. It is a
                        fixed value determined by the motor construction.
                        <b>Key points about step angle:</b>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Smaller step angle gives higher position accuracy.</li>
                        <li>PM stepper motors typically have step angles such as 7.5°, 15°, or 18°.</li>
                        <li>Total steps per revolution = 360° / step angle.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Single-phase excitation,</b> where one winding is energized at a time.</li>

                            torque.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        A <strong>Hybrid Stepper Motor</strong> is a type of stepper motor that combines the features of
                        <strong>Permanent Magnet
                            (PM) stepper motors</strong> and <strong>Variable Reluctance (VR) stepper motors.</strong>
                        This combination results in
                        high positioning accuracy, better torque characteristics, and smooth operation. Hybrid stepper
                        motors are the most widely used stepper motors in modern industrial automation and precision
                        control applications.

                    <h2>Construction of Hybrid Stepper Motor</h2>
                    <p>
                        The construction of a hybrid stepper motor includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Stator: </b> The stator consists of multiple toothed poles with windings arranged in
                            phases. These windings are energized in a specific sequence to create a rotating magnetic
                            field.</li>
                        <li><b>Rotor: </b> The rotor is made of a permanent magnet placed between two toothed iron cups.
                            One cup has north polarity and the other has south polarity. The rotor teeth are offset
                            slightly from each other to increase step resolution.</li>
                        <li><b>Shaft and Bearings: </b> The rotor is mounted on a shaft supported by bearings for smooth

                    <p>
                        The combination of a permanent magnet rotor and toothed structure gives the motor high
                        precision.

                    <h2>Working Principle</h2>
                    <p>
                        The working principle of a hybrid stepper motor is based on <strong>magnetic attraction and
                            variable
                            reluctance.</strong> When a stator phase is energized, magnetic flux is produced, and the
                        rotor aligns
                        itself to the position of minimum reluctance. As stator phases are energized sequentially, the
                        rotor moves step by step. <br><br>
                        Each input pulse rotates the shaft by a fixed angle known as the <strong>step angle.</strong>
                        The direction of
                        rotation depends on the order of phase excitation.

                    <!-- <h2>PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)</h2>
                    <p>A programmable Logic Controller(PLC) is a specialized digital computer employed in industrial
                        settings for automation and control. Acting as the central brain of machinery and processes,
                        PLCs receive input from sensors, process the data through programmed logic, and generate output
                        signals to control devices like motors and valves. They use a programming language, often ladder
                        logic, resembling electrical relay diagrams. PLCs are ruggedized for harsh industrial
                        environments and play a crucial role in automating tasks and reducing manufacturing and energy.
                        Their modular design allows scalability, making them versatile components in modern industrial
                        control systems.</p>

                    <p>
                        PLCs play a pivotal role in industrial automation, efficiently managing machinery and processes.
                        They receive data from sensors, execute programmed logic, and control actuators, enhancing
                        precision and reducing manual intervention. PLCs find application across diverse industries,
                        from manufacturing to utilities, ensuring streamlined operations, increased productivity, and
                        adaptability to evolving production needs. Their robust capabilities make PLCs indispensable in
                        modern industrial settings, facilities with seamless control and automation for improved
                        efficiency and reliability.
