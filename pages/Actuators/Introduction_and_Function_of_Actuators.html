                    <h2>Definition of Actuators</h2>
                    <p>
                        An actuator is a device that converts electrical, pneumatic, or hydraulic energy into physical
                        movement or mechanical action.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Functional Block diagram of Actuator</h2>
                    <p>Typically, an actuator consists of: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Energy source: </b> Energy sources provide actuators with the ability to do work.
                            Actuators draw electrical or mechanical energy from external sources for carrying out their
                            operation. The energy available to the actuator can be regulated or unregulated depending on
                            the system that it is a part of.</li>
                        <li><b>Power converter: </b> If the energy source attached to the actuators is unregulated, it
                            requires some additional apparatus to regulate it and convert it into a form suitable for
                            the actuation action. Hydraulic control valves or solid-state power electronic converters
                            are examples of converters used in industrial actuators.</li>
                        <li><b>Controller: </b> In addition to enabling the operation of the power converter, a control
                            unit is responsible for generating actuating electrical/control signals. In some systems, it
                            provides the user with an interface to provide inputs or check the system’s status.</li>
                        <li><b>Load: </b> The mechanical system attached to the actuator that uses the motion of the
                            actuator is called the load. Characteristics like Force/Torque and Speed are carefully tuned
                            before interfacing an actuator with the load.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- <h2>PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)</h2>
                    <p>A programmable Logic Controller(PLC) is a specialized digital computer employed in industrial
                        settings for automation and control. Acting as the central brain of machinery and processes,
                        PLCs receive input from sensors, process the data through programmed logic, and generate output
                        signals to control devices like motors and valves. They use a programming language, often ladder
                        logic, resembling electrical relay diagrams. PLCs are ruggedized for harsh industrial
                        environments and play a crucial role in automating tasks and reducing manufacturing and energy.
                        Their modular design allows scalability, making them versatile components in modern industrial
                        control systems.</p>
