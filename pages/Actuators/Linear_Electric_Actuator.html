                    <h2>Linear Electric Actuators</h2>
                    <p>
                        A linear electric actuator is an electromechanical device that converts electrical energy into
                        linear (straight-line) motion. Unlike rotary motors that produce circular motion, linear
                        electric actuators generate controlled push-and-pull movement. They are widely used in
                        industrial automation, robotics, medical equipment, and positioning systems where precise linear
                        motion is required.
                        <br><br>Linear electric actuators provide accurate motion control, easy integration with
                        electronic control systems, and clean operation compared to pneumatic or hydraulic actuators.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Construction of Linear Electric Actuators</h2>
                    <p>A typical linear electric actuator consists of the following main components:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Electric Motor: </b> Usually a DC motor, stepper motor, or servo motor that provides the
                            rotational input.</li>
                        <li><b>Gearbox: </b> Reduces motor speed and increases torque to drive the linear mechanism
                            effectively.</li>
                        <li><b>Lead Screw or Ball Screw: </b> Converts rotary motion of the motor into linear motion of
                            the actuator rod.</li>
                        <li><b>Actuator Rod (Slider): </b> Moves linearly to push or pull a load.</li>
                        <li><b>Housing and Bearings: </b> Provide mechanical support, alignment, and protection.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Some actuators also include limit switches or position sensors for motion control.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Working Principle</h2>
                    <p>
                        The working principle of a linear electric actuator is based on rotary-to-linear motion
                        conversion. When electrical power is supplied, the motor rotates. This rotation is transmitted
                        through a gearbox to a lead screw or ball screw. As the screw rotates, the actuator rod moves
                        forward or backward along the axis.
                        <br><br>The direction of motion depends on the polarity or control signal applied to the motor.
                        Speed, position, and force can be controlled using electronic controllers.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Types of Linear Electric Actuators</h2>
                    <p>
                        Linear electric actuators can be classified based on their drive mechanism and motor type.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Lead Screw Actuators: </b> Use a threaded screw and nut arrangement. They are
                            cost-effective and suitable for moderate loads.</li>
                        <li><b>Ball Screw Actuators: </b> Use ball bearings between the screw and nut, offering high
                            efficiency, accuracy, and longer life.</li>
                        <li><b>Stepper Motor Actuators: </b> Provide precise step-by-step position control without
                            feedback.</li>
                        <li><b>Servo Motor Actuators: </b> Offer high precision, closed-loop control, and fast response.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The selection depends on load, accuracy, speed, and application requirements.
                    </p>
