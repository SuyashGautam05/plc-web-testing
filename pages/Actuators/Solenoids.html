                    <h2>Solenoids</h2>
                    <p>
                        A solenoid is an electromechanical device that converts electrical energy into linear mechanical
                        motion. It consists of a coil of wire wound around a cylindrical core, inside which a movable
                        iron plunger is placed. When electric current flows through the coil, a magnetic field is
                        produced that pulls the plunger into the coil, generating a straight-line motion.
                        <br><br>Solenoids are widely used in industrial automation and control systems for switching,
                        locking, positioning, and actuation purposes.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Construction of a Solenoid</h2>
                    <p>The main components of a solenoid are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Coil (Winding): </b> Made of insulated copper wire, the coil generates a magnetic field
                            when energized.</li>
                        <li><b>Plunger (Armature): </b> A movable soft iron core that is pulled into the coil when the
                            solenoid is energized.</li>
                        <li><b>Return Spring: </b> Returns the plunger to its original position when power is removed.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Housing: </b> Provides mechanical support and protection to the solenoid components.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The construction is simple, robust, and suitable for repeated operation.</p>
                    <h2>Working Principle</h2>
                    <p>The working principle of a solenoid is based on electromagnetism. When an electric current flows
                        through the solenoid coil, it produces a magnetic field. This magnetic field creates a force
                        that attracts the iron plunger into the center of the coil.</p>
                    <p>
                        When the supply is switched off, the magnetic field collapses, and the return spring pushes the
                        plunger back to its original position. Thus, electrical energy is converted into controlled
                        linear motion.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Types of Solenoids</h2>
                    <p>Solenoids are classified based on their operation and application:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Pull-type Solenoid: </b> The plunger is pulled inward when energized.</li>
                        <li><b>Push-type Solenoid: </b> The plunger moves outward when energized.</li>
                        <li><b>DC Solenoid: </b> Operates on direct current and is commonly used in automation systems.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>AC Solenoid: </b> Operates on alternating current and is used in industrial valves and
                            contactors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Each type is selected based on force, stroke length, and operating conditions.</p>
                    <h2>Characteristics of Solenoids</h2>
                    <p>Important characteristics include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Linear motion output.</li>
                        <li>High force at short stroke length.</li>
                        <li>Fast response time.</li>
                        <li>Simple ON/OFF control.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        However, the force decreases as the plunger moves away from the energized position.
                    </p>
