                    <h2>AC Motors</h2>
                    <p>
                        Alternating current (AC) powers nearly every modern device. However, many people may not realize
                        the critical role AC motors play in powering countless machines. Understanding AC motors and
                        their types can help you optimize applications and enhance operational efficiency.<br><br>AC
                        motors are driven by alternating current and work based on the principles of electromagnetism.
                        This connection between AC power and electromagnetism enables motors to convert electrical
                        energy into mechanical movement.<br><br>AC motors are essential components in various industrial
                        and household applications. To dive deeper into their functionality, let's explore how they work
                        and why they are indispensable.
                    </p>
                    <h2>How AC Motors Work?</h2>
                    <p>
                        AC motors convert electrical energy into mechanical energy through the interaction of a magnetic
                        field and a conductor. The process involves alternating current flowing through coils in the
                        stator, which generates a rotating magnetic field. This field induces current in the rotor,
                        causing it to turn. The motion of the rotor creates mechanical torque that powers the machinery
                        or equipment connected to the motor. There are two primary types of AC motors: synchronous
                        motors and induction motors.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Single-Phase Induction Motor</h2>
                    <p>
                        Single-phase induction motors are commonly used in household appliances such as fans,
                        refrigerators, and washing machines. They require only one phase of power supply and are
                        typically used for smaller loads. However, single-phase induction motors are not self-starting,
                        so they require an auxiliary mechanism like a starting capacitor or a split-phase to initiate
                        motion.

                        <li><b>Stator: </b>
                            The stator is the stationary part of the motor, and it has a core made of laminated steel to
                            reduce energy losses. Inside the stator, there are copper windings where the alternating
                            current (AC) flows. These windings are responsible for creating the magnetic field needed to
                            make the rotor spin. Some motors also have an auxiliary winding or a capacitor connected to
                            the stator to help the motor start.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Rotor: </b>
                            The rotor is the part that rotates. It’s usually a squirrel cage design, meaning it has bars
                            made of copper or aluminum connected at the ends by rings. These bars form a closed loop.
                            When the magnetic field from the stator interacts with the rotor, it induces a current in
                            these bars, which causes the rotor to spin. The motor also includes a shaft connected to the
                            rotor, bearings to support the shaft and allow it to rotate smoothly, and a frame to hold
                            everything together.

                    <p><b>Working Principle of Single-Phase Induction Motors</b></p>
                    <p>Single-phase induction motors work through electromagnetic induction. When connected to a
                        single-phase AC power supply, the stator winding creates a changing magnetic field. This field
                        induces a current in the rotor, which then forms its own magnetic field. The interaction between
                        these magnetic fields produces the force needed to rotate the rotor. <br><br>The alternating
                        magnetic field in the stator, driven by the AC supply, induces an electromotive force (EMF) in
                        the rotor conductors based on Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction. This induced EMF
                        generates currents in the rotor bars, typically made of aluminum or copper. These currents
                        create a secondary magnetic field around the rotor bars. The interaction between the stator's
                        and rotor's magnetic fields generates a force, known as Lorentz force, which produces the torque
                        to spin the rotor. <br><br>The motor reaches a steady state where the rotor speed is slightly
                        less than the synchronous speed of the stator's magnetic field. This speed difference, called
                        slip, is needed for the continuous induction of current in the rotor, keeping the motor running.
                        As long as the AC power supply is present, this process continues, driving the motor's rotation.
                        <br><br>To start the motor, mechanisms such as capacitors or auxiliary windings are used to
                        create an initial phase shift, generating a rotating magnetic field to start the rotor. Once the
                        rotor gains enough speed, these starting aids are usually disconnected, allowing the motor to
                        run on the main winding. Regular maintenance, including checking the load and ensuring proper
                        ventilation, helps prevent issues like overheating and mechanical wear, ensuring good
                        performance and long life.

                        A three-phase induction motor is a type of AC induction motor that deals with a phase supply
                        when diverged from the single-phase induction motor where the single-phase supply is supposed to
                        work. The three-phase supply current makes an electromagnetic field in the stator winding which
                        prompts the production of the torque in the rotor bending of the three-phase induction motor
                        having a magnetic field.

                        The construction of an induction motor is exceptionally basic and robust. It has predominantly

                            The stator outline is the external piece of the motor. The capability of the stator outline
                            is to offer help to the stator core and stator winding. It gives mechanical strength to the
                            inward pieces of the motor. The casing has balances on the external surface for heat
                            dissemination and cooling of the motor.

                            stampings with a thickness ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 mm.

                            The stator winding is positioned within the available spaces inside the stator core. The
                            stator winding consists of three phases, and a three-phase power supply is provided to it.
                            <br><br>The motor's pole count is determined by the internal arrangement of the stator
                            winding, and it Controls the motor's speed. When the number of poles is higher, the speed is
                            lower, whereas if the number of poles is fewer, the speed is higher. The poles are generally
                            two by two. Subsequently, the absolute number of poles generally a much number. The
                            connection between simultaneous speed and number poles is as displayed in the below
                            equation, <br><br>
